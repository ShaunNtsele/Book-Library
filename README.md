This is a Web API written in ASP.Net which is used to manage book library. Authors can be created and assigned to each to book or a collection of books. The Swagger UI can be used to test the functionality of the Web API. The Web API is written using .Net 6. The application also supports authentication and generates a token for valid user credentials using the Swagger UI.

To use the web api:
1. After downloading or cloning the repository, open it using VS Code.
2. Create the database on your local system. Using VS code: Open a new terminal and run "dotnet ef database update".
3. To test the functionality of the web api, use the Swagger UI that has already been configured for the project. Start debugging the application (F5) and the application will be hosted on a local server. Append the URL that appears in the browser tab that has been opened with "swagger".
4. The functionality of the web app can now be tested.

Feel free to make any changes, suggestions or updates to the code. You may also use Visual Studio to test the application, although some minor changes to the source code may need to be made.
